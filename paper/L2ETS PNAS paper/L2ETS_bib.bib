              Rossel Island",
  author   = "Levinson, Stephen C",
  abstract = "This paper describes the terminology used to describe parts of
              the body in Y{\'e}l{\^\i} Dnye, the Papuan language of Rossel
              Island (Papua New Guinea). The terms are nouns, which display
              complex patterns of suppletion in possessive and locative uses.
              Many of the terms are compounds, many unanalysable. Semantically,
              visible body parts divide into three main types: (i) a partonomic
              subsystem dividing the body into nine major parts: head, neck,
              two upper limbs, trunk, two upper legs, two lower legs, (ii)
              designated surfaces (e.g. `lower belly'), (iii) collections of
              surface features (`face'), (iv) taxonomic subsystems (e.g. `big
              toe' being a kind of `toe'). With regards to (i), the lack of any
              designation for `foot' or `hand' is notable, as is the absence of
              a term for `leg' as a whole (although this is a lexical not a
              conceptual gap, as shown by the alternate taboo vocabulary).
              Y{\'e}l{\^\i} Dnye body part terms do not have major extensions
              to other domains (e.g. spatial relators). Indeed, a number of the
              terms are clearly borrowed from outside human biology (e.g. `wing
              butt' for shoulder).",

  abstract = "Cognitive psychologists and cognitive anthropologists alike have
              been concerned with how the human mind divides entities in the
              world into categories. Cognitive psychologists have recently
              begun approaching this issue by asking a question long of
              interest to anthropologists: To what extent are the categories
              given by structure in the environment, and to what extent are
              they created through constructive processes on the part of the
              human categorizer? Despite this shared question, relatively
              little of the data available in the anthropological literature
              has become familiar to psychologists. Psychologists stand to
              benefit from greater acquaintance with this literature, since the
              cross-cultural studies have often addressed the relative roles of
              structure in the environment vs constructive processes by the
              observer more directly than psychological studies have.
              Furthermore, cross-cultural data provide a unique opportunity to
              separate culture-specific from universal aspects of
              categorization. This paper sketches positions on the nature of
              category formation that have been put forth in the psychological
              literature. It then reviews in detail four areas of
              anthropological research that are relevant to evaluating the
              psychological perspectives. The cross- cultural data provide
              substantial constraints for theories of category coherence.",

               others, but these studies have not offered a convincing account
               for why this is the case. We arrive at such an account through
               an experiment that targets a wide variety of analogy questions
               and defines a baseline condition to more accurately measure the
               efficacy of our system. We find that the most reliably solvable
               analogy categories involve either 1) the application of a
               morpheme with clear syntactic effects, 2) male--female
               alternations, or 3) named entities. These broader types do not
               pattern cleanly along a syntactic--semantic divide. We suggest
               instead that their commonality is distributional, in that the

  author    = "Landau, Barbara and Jackendoff, Ray",
  abstract  = "Fundamental to spatial knowledge in all species are the
               representations underlying object recognition, object search,
               and navigation through space. But what sets humans apart from
               other species is our ability to express spatial experience
               through language. This target article explores the language of
               objects and places, asking what geometric properties are
               preserved in the representations underlying object nouns and
               spatial prepositions in English. Evidence from these two aspects
               of language suggests there are significant differences in the
               geometric richness with which objects and places are encoded.
               When an object is named (i.e., with count nouns), detailed
               geometric properties -- principally the object's shape (axes,
               solid and hollow volumes, surfaces, and parts) -- are
               represented. In contrast, when an object plays the role of
               either ``figure'' (located object) or ``ground'' (reference
               object) in a locational expression, only very coarse geometric
               object properties are represented, primarily the main axes. In
               addition, the spatial functions encoded by spatial prepositions
               tend to be nonmetric and relatively coarse, for example,
               ``containment,'' ``contact,'' ``relative distance,'' and
               ``relative direction.'' These properties are representative of
               other languages as well. The striking differences in the way
               language encodes objects versus places lead us to suggest two
               explanations: First, there is a tendency for languages to level
               out geometric detail from both object and place representations.
               Second, a nonlinguistic disparity between the representations of
               ``what'' and ``where'' underlies how language represents objects
               and places. The language of objects and places converges with
               and enriches our understanding of corresponding spatial
               representations.",

                   signals and many clever tricks. By contrast, little

                   these embeddings, with cosine similarity being used
                   unquestionably in the majority of cases. In this work, we
                   illustrate that for all common word vectors, cosine

  abstract = "I examine Gleitman's (1990) arguments that children rely on a
              verb's syntactic subcategorization frames to learn its meaning
              (e.g., they learn that see means `perceive visually' because it
              can appear with a direct object, a clausal complement, or a
              directional phrase). First, Gleitman argues that the verbs cannot
              be learned byb observing then situations in which they are used ,
              because many verbs refer to overlapping situations, and because
              parents do not invariably use a verb when its perceptual
              correlates are present. I suggest that these arguments speak only
              against a narrow associationist view in which the child is
              sensitive to the temporal contiguity of sensory features and
              spoken verb, If the child can hyppthesize semantic
              representations corresponding to what parents are likely to be
              referring to, and can refine such representations across multiple
              situations, the objections are blunted;, indeed, Gleitman's
              theory requires such a learning process despite her objections to
              it. Second, Gleitmans suggests that there is enough information
              in a verb's subcategorization frames to predict its meaning
              `quite closely' . Evaluating this argument requires
              distinguishing a verb's root plus its semantic content (what She
              boiled the water shares with The water boiled and does not share
              with She broke the glass), and a verb frame plus its semantic
              perspective (what She boiled the water shares with She broke the
              glass and does not share with The water boiled). I show that
              learning a verb in a single frame only gives a learner coarse
              information about its semanic perspective in that frame (e.g.,
              number of arguments, type of arguments); it tells the learner
              nothing about the verb root's content across frames (e.g., hot
              bubbling liquid). Moreover, hearing a verb across all its frames
              also reveals little about the verb root's content. Finally, I
              show that Gleitman's empirical arguments all involve experiments
              where children are exposed to a single verb frame, and therefore
              all involve learning the frame's perpective meaning, not the
              root's content meaning, which in all the experiments was acquired
              by observing the accompanying scene. I conclude that attention to
              a verb's syntactic frame can help narrow down the child's
              interpretation of the perspective meaning of the verb in that
              frame, but disagree with the claim that there is some
              in-principle limitation in learning a verb's content.",

               processes as computational, computation itself presupposes an
               internal medium of representation. Fodor's prime concerns are to
               buttress the notion of internal representation from a
               philosophical viewpoint, and to determine those characteristics
               of this conceptual construct using the empirical data available

              organized in the human brain may reflect distinct features of
              cultural, historical, and environmental background in addition to
              properties universal to human cognition. Semantics, or meaning
              expressed through language, provides indirect access to the
              underlying conceptual structure, but meaning is notoriously
              difficult to measure, let alone parameterize. Here, we provide an
              empirical measure of semantic proximity between concepts using
              cross-linguistic dictionaries to translate words to and from
              languages carefully selected to be representative of worldwide
              diversity. These translations reveal cases where a particular
              language uses a single ``polysemous'' word to express multiple
              concepts that another language represents using distinct words.
              We use the frequency of such polysemies linking two concepts as a
              measure of their semantic proximity and represent the pattern of
              these linkages by a weighted network. This network is highly
              structured: Certain concepts are far more prone to polysemy than
              others, and naturally interpretable clusters of closely related
              concepts emerge. Statistical analysis of the polysemies observed
              in a subset of the basic vocabulary shows that these structural
              properties are consistent across different language groups, and
              largely independent of geography, environment, and the presence
              or absence of a literary tradition. The methods developed here
              can be applied to any semantic domain to reveal the extent to
              which its conceptual structure is, similarly, a universal
              attribute of human cognition and language use.",

               indicative of the quality of the embedding. We question this

               linear offset may still be recoverable by a more sophisticated

               The general problem with linear offset is its sensitivity to the
               idiosyncrasies of individual words. We show that simple
               averaging over multiple word pairs improves over the
               state-of-the-art. A further improvement in accuracy (up to 30\%

              verbs. Attempts to understand the difficulty of verb learning
              have focused on determining whether the challenge stems from
              differences in the linguistic usage of nouns and verbs, or
              instead conceptual differences in the categories that they label.
              We introduce a novel metric to quantify the contributions of both
              sources of difficulty using unsupervised learning models trained
              on corpora of language and images. We find that there is less
              alignment between the linguistic usage of verbs and their

              difference is driven almost entirely by differences in the

              described by the same verb are more variable and events described
              by two different verbs are more similar. We conclude that
              differences between noun and verb learning need not be due to
              fundamental differences in learning processes, but may instead be
              driven by the difficulty of one-shot generalization from verbs'

  title    = "Turning the tables: Language and spatial reasoning",
  author   = "Li, Peggy and Gleitman, Lila",
  abstract = "This paper investigates possible influences of the lexical
              resources of individual languages on the spatial organization and
              reasoning styles of their users. That there are such powerful and
              pervasive influences of language on thought is the thesis of the
              Whorf-Sapir linguistic relativity hypothesis which, after a
              lengthy period in intellectual limbo, has recently returned to
              prominence in the anthropological, linguistic, and
              psycholinguistic literatures. Our point of departure is an
              influential group of cross-linguistic studies that appear to show
              that spatial reasoning is strongly affected by the spatial
              lexicon in everyday use in a community (e.g. Brown, P., \&
              Levinson, S. C. (1993). Linguistic and nonlinguistic coding of
              spatial arrays: explorations in Mayan cognition (Working Paper
              No. 24). Nijmegen: Cognitive Anthropology Research Group, Max
              Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics; Cognitive Linguistics 6
              (1995) 33). Specifically, certain groups customarily use an
              externally referenced spatial-coordinate system to refer to
              nearby directions and positions (``to the north'') whereas
              English speakers usually employ a viewer-perspective system (``to
              the left''). Prior findings and interpretations have been to the
              effect that users of these two types of spatial system solve
              rotation problems in different ways, reasoning strategies imposed
              by habitual use of the language-particular lexicons themselves.
              The present studies reproduce these different problem-solving
              strategies in speakers of a single language (English) by
              manipulating landmark cues, suggesting that language itself may
              not be the key causal factor in choice of spatial perspective.
              Prior evidence on rotation problem solution from infants (e.g.
              Acredolo, L.P. (1979). Laboratory versus home: the effect of
              environment on the 9-month-old infant's choice of spatial
              reference system. Developmental Psychology, 15 (6), 666-667) and
              from laboratory animals (e.g. Restle, F. (1975). Discrimination
              of cues in mazes: a resolution of the place-vs.-response
              question. Psychological Review, 64, 217-228) suggests a unified
              interpretation of the findings: creatures approach spatial
              problems differently depending on the availability and
              suitability of local landmark cues. The results are discussed in
              terms of the current debate on the relation of language to
              thought, with particular emphasis on the question of why
              different cultural communities favor different perspectives in
              talking about space.",

  abstract  = "The question of complexity, as in what makes one language more
               'complex' than another, is a long-established topic of debate
               amongst linguists. Recently, this issue has been complemented
               with the view that languages are complex adaptive systems, in
               which emergence and self-organization play major roles. However,
               few students of the phenomenon have gone beyond the basic
               assessment of the number of units and rules in a language (what
               has been characterized as 'bit complexity') or shown some
               familiarity with the science of complexity. This book reveals
               how much can be learned by overcoming these limitations,
               especially by adopting developmental and evolutionary
               perspectives. The contributors include specialists of language
               acquisition, evolution and ecology, grammaticization, phonology,
               and modeling, all of whom approach languages as dynamical,
               emergent, and adaptive complex systems.",
