lupyan paper
- concrete meanings not related to alignment; rather related to the degree to which a system has internal struture (extreme relativism)
- related to cultural, geographic, language history
- verbs aligned less than nouns --- maybe?
- dif frequency and semantic densitiy, lower alignment

Qs: 
- what do you think of their method? why would this lead to differences?
- dig into concreteness data
- collect behavioral data?

difference: OUr paper is about local vs. global, better method
similarity: concreteness (but most of their meanings are concrete), but different claim; look at geographcial predictors
coneptyalzion
- third words matters: our method takes this into account, and semantic densitiy is suggestive of this
- our focus is different: local vs. clogbal

REANALYSIS:
- 1010 words
- in thompson, compared cross-linguistically by translation of neighbord 
- our method: system level (considering all pairs), no translation
- divide by domains


- are there domains abstract that are low? that they missed (and vice versa)

TO DO: Compare different clustering solutions in multiple languages
* V-measure to compare different clustering solutions -> how much overlap in clusters is there between (this measure is asymmetric)
* Could show that analyses holds with a couple languages for 10 cluster solutions
* could show that it holds for all languages for 10 cluster solution
